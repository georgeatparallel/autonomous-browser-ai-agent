# Browser Agent AI

An autonomous AI-powered browser automation system that performs real-time intelligent web searches using browser control and workflow automation.

Built with:

- FastAPI
- Playwright
- Streamlit
- n8n
- ngrok

The project simulates a lightweight browser agent capable of searching the internet, scraping live results, and displaying them through a modern AI-style interface.

# ✨ Overview

This project combines browser automation with workflow orchestration to create a real-time AI search agent.

Instead of relying on APIs, the system opens a real browser using Playwright, performs searches dynamically, extracts search results, and returns them through an automated n8n pipeline.

The frontend is built with Streamlit and designed with a modern dark AI-agent style UI.
